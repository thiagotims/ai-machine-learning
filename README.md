 This repository contains studies and projects of machine learning and artificial intelligence.
 
 #### 📌 Neural Networks (basics) - Curso NLP (USP).ipynb
 - File with activities from list 2 of the course Neural Processing of Natural Language (USP/Coursera). Content: basics in neural networks.
 
 #### 📌 Random Forest com MLflow: Registro e Comparação de Modelos em Classificação de Crédito (📁 MLFlow-RF)
 (Random Forest with MLflow: Registration and Comparison of Models in Credit Classification)
 - This project implements a complete binary classification pipeline with Random Forest applied to the German Credit database. The focus is on traceability and comparative analysis of multiple model runs using MLflow. The goal is to explore the impact of different hyperparameters on model results and automatically record these variations with MLflow, enabling comparison and tracking of the best results. The final model is selected based on accuracy and automatically registered in the Model Registry.
 
 #### 📌 Monitoramento de Treinamento com MLflow em Redes Neurais Keras (📁 MLFlow_NNs_Keras)
 (Training Monitoring with MLflow on Keras Neural Networks)
 - This project demonstrates how to integrate MLflow to track and monitor the training of a neural network built with Keras (via TensorFlow) using the MNIST dataset. The application demonstrates the use of autologging to automatically record parameters, metrics, model, and visualizations, with a focus on ease of reproducibility and transparency in machine learning experiments.
 
 #### 📌 MLflow Credit Scoring: Deploy de Modelo com API Local (📁 deploy-local)
 (MLflow Credit Scoring: Deploying a Model with a Local API)
 - This project demonstrates how to serve a Machine Learning model trained with MLflow to predict credit risk, using a local API. Ideal for educational purposes, the application shows how to deploy it in a practical, lightweight way and without relying on automated virtual environments.

#### 📌 MLflow Credit Scoring: Deploy via PyFuncModel (📁 deploy-PyFuncModel)
- This project demonstrates an alternative approach to using Machine Learning models trained with MLflow, making predictions directly in Python with the PyFuncModel interface, without the need for a local API.

#### 📌 Redução de Dimensionalidade em Imagens (📁 img-dimensionality-reduction)
(Dimensionality Reduction in Images)
- This Python project performs transformations on color images, reducing the amount of visual information through two main operations: conversion to grayscale and binarization (black and white). The goal is to demonstrate how to reduce the complexity of images to facilitate analysis or further processing, without relying on complex image processing libraries beyond native Python and PIL for basic manipulation. This project was implemented as part of the *BairesDev - Machine Learning Training* course project challenge, promoted by BairesDev in partnership with Dio.
