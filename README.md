#### Random Forest com MLflow: Registro e Comparação de Modelos em Classificação de Crédito
- This project implements a complete binary classification pipeline with Random Forest applied to the German Credit database. The focus is on traceability and comparative analysis of multiple model runs using MLflow. The goal is to explore the impact of different hyperparameters on model results and automatically record these variations with MLflow, enabling comparison and tracking of the best results. The final model is selected based on accuracy and automatically registered in the Model Registry.
