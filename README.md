 This repository contains studies and projects of machine learning and artificial intelligence.
 
 #### 📌 Neural Networks (basics) - Curso NLP (USP).ipynb
 - File with activities from list 2 of the course Neural Processing of Natural Language (USP/Coursera). Content: basics in neural networks.
 
 #### 📌 Random Forest com MLflow: Registro e Comparação de Modelos em Classificação de Crédito (📁 MLFlow-RF)
 (Random Forest with MLflow: Registration and Comparison of Models in Credit Classification)
 - This project implements a complete binary classification pipeline with Random Forest applied to the German Credit database. The focus is on traceability and comparative analysis of multiple model runs using MLflow. The goal is to explore the impact of different hyperparameters on model results and automatically record these variations with MLflow, enabling comparison and tracking of the best results. The final model is selected based on accuracy and automatically registered in the Model Registry.
 
 #### 📌 Monitoramento de Treinamento com MLflow em Redes Neurais Keras (📁 MLFlow_NNs_Keras)
 (Training Monitoring with MLflow on Keras Neural Networks)
 - This project demonstrates how to integrate MLflow to track and monitor the training of a neural network built with Keras (via TensorFlow) using the MNIST dataset. The application demonstrates the use of autologging to automatically record parameters, metrics, model, and visualizations, with a focus on ease of reproducibility and transparency in machine learning experiments.
 
 #### 📌 MLflow Credit Scoring: Deploy de Modelo com API Local (📁 deploy-local)
 (MLflow Credit Scoring: Deploying a Model with a Local API)
 - This project demonstrates how to serve a Machine Learning model trained with MLflow to predict credit risk, using a local API. Ideal for educational purposes, the application shows how to deploy it in a practical, lightweight way and without relying on automated virtual environments.

#### 📌 MLflow Credit Scoring: Deploy via PyFuncModel (📁 deploy-PyFuncModel)
- This project demonstrates an alternative approach to using Machine Learning models trained with MLflow, making predictions directly in Python with the PyFuncModel interface, without the need for a local API.

#### 📌 Redução de Dimensionalidade em Imagens (📁 img-dimensionality-reduction)
(Dimensionality Reduction in Images)
- This Python project performs transformations on color images, reducing the amount of visual information through two main operations: conversion to grayscale and binarization (black and white). The goal is to demonstrate how to reduce the complexity of images to facilitate analysis or further processing, without relying on complex image processing libraries beyond native Python and PIL for basic manipulation. This project was implemented as part of the *BairesDev - Machine Learning Training* course project challenge, promoted by BairesDev in partnership with Dio.

#### 📌 Cálculo de Métricas de Avaliação de Aprendizado em Machine Learning (📁 evaluation-metrics-ML)
(Calculating Machine Learning Evaluation Metrics)
- This project demonstrates how to calculate the main metrics used in evaluating Machine Learning models. It also uses an interactive confusion matrix (with sliders in Jupyter Notebook) to allow visualization and experimentation of the results in real time. This project was implemented as part of the *BairesDev - Machine Learning Training* course project challenge, promoted by BairesDev in partnership with Dio.

#### 📌 Treinamento da Rede YOLOv8 com a base de dados COCO128 no Google Colab (📁 train-YOLO)
(YOLOv8 Network Training with the COCO128 Database on Google Colab)
- This project demonstrates the training of a YOLOv8 network using the COCO128 dataset, running entirely on Google Colab and saving results directly to Google Drive. It was implemented as part of the BairesDev - Machine Learning Training course project challenge, promoted by BairesDev in partnership with Dio.

#### 📌 Sistema de Reconhecimento Facial com FaceScrub (📁 facial-recognition)
(Facial Recognition System with FaceScrub)
- This project presents a celebrity facial recognition system developed in Python, using TensorFlow/Keras for training and MTCNN for face detection. The project was implemented and tested directly on Google Colab, using the platform's free GPU access. This project was implemented as a "project challenge" for the BairesDev - Machine Learning Training course, promoted by BairesDev in partnership with Dio.
